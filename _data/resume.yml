      **Abstract**: The growing number of health-data breaches, the use of genomic databases for law enforcement purposes and the lack of transparency of personal-genomics companies are raising unprecedented privacy concerns. To enable a secure exploration of genomic datasets with controlled and transparent data access, we propose a novel approach that combines cryptographic privacy-preserving technologies, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation, with the auditability of blockchains. This approach provides strong security guarantees against realistic threat models by empowering individual citizens to decide who can query and access their genomic data and by ensuring end-to-end data confidentiality. Our open-source implementation supports queries on the encrypted genomic data of hundreds of thousands of individuals, with minimal overhead. Our work opens a path towards multi-functional, privacy-preserving genomic-data analysis.

      **Abstract**: MedCo is the first operational system that makes sensitive medical-data available for research in a simple, privacy-conscious and secure way. It enables a consortium of clinical sites to collectively protect their data and to securely share them with investigators, without single points of failure. In this short paper, we report on our ongoing effort for the operational deployment of MedCo within the context of the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) for the Swiss Molecular Tumor Board.

      **Abstract**: Medical studies are usually time consuming, cumbersome and extremely costly to perform, and for exploratory research, their results are also difficult to predict a priori. This is particularly the case for rare diseases, for which finding enough patients is difficult and usually requires an international-scale research. In this case, the process can be even more difficult due to the heterogeneity of data-protection regulations, making the data sharing process particularly hard. In this short paper, we propose MedCo2 (pronounced MedCo square), a distributed system that streamlines the process of a medical study by bridging and enabling both data discovery and data analysis among multiple databases, while protecting data confidentiality and patients’ privacy. MedCo2 relies on interactive protocols, homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. It enables the privacy-preserving computations of multiple statistics such as cosine similarity and variance, and the training of machine learning models, on patients that are obliviously selected according to specific criteria among multiple databases.

      **Abstract**: The increasing number of health-data breaches is creating a complicated environment for medical-data sharing and, consequently, for medical progress. Therefore, the development of new solutions that can reassure clinical sites by enabling privacy-preserving sharing of sensitive medical data in compliance with stringent regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is now more urgent than ever. In this work, we introduce MedCo, the first operational system that enables a group of clinical sites to federate and collectively protect their data in order to share them with external investigators without worrying about security and privacy concerns. MedCo uses (a) collective homomorphic encryption to provide trust decentralization and end-to-end confidentiality protection, and (b) obfuscation techniques to achieve formal notions of privacy, such as differential privacy. A critical feature of MedCo is that it is fully integrated within the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) framework, currently used in more than 300 hospitals worldwide. Therefore, it is easily adoptable by clinical sites. We demonstrate MedCo's practicality by testing it on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas in a simulated network of three institutions. Its performance is comparable to the ones of SHRINE (networked i2b2), which, in contrast, does not provide any data protection guarantee.

    summary: "**Abstract**: Being able to exploit large and heterogeneous medical data
    is crucial for realizing the promise of precision medicine to its full potential.
    Yet, currently, due to the presence of multiple and fragmented systems at different
    clinical sites, it is often difficult to enable researchers to access the data
    they need. Privacy and security concerns also represent major obstacles that need
    to be overcome in order to provide access to sensitive medical data that are usually
    not exposed by clinical sites for the fear of data leaks. To address these challenges,
    we propose a system that employs Glowing Bear as a common front end to the widespread
    clinical research platforms i2b2, tranSMART and MedCo. Our proposed system uses
    IRCT, the official implementation of the PIC-SURE API, which acts as an interoperability
    layer that translates clinical research queries into native API languages. With
    our work, we take a step towards the technical convergence of i2b2 and tranSMART,
    giving clinical sites the means to share their data more easily. Even more, with
    the support of MedCo, a cohort explorer with strong privacy and security guarantees
    based on federated i2b2 instances, we enable clinical sites to share sensitive
    data that would be difficult to share otherwise."

      **Abstract**: Being able to share large amounts of sensitive clinical and genomic data across several institutions is crucial for precision medicine to scale up. Unfortunately, existing solutions only partially address this challenge and are still unable to provide the strong privacy and security guarantees required by regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR). As a result, currently only very limited datasets of non-sensitive and moderately useful information can be shared. In this paper, we introduce MedCo, the first operational system that enables an investigator to explore sensitive medical information distributed at several sites and protected with collective homomorphic encryption. MedCo builds on top of established and widespread technology from the biomedical informatics community, such as i2b2 and SHRINE, and relies on state-of-the-art secure protocols for processing encrypted distributed data and complying with regulations. As such, MedCo can be easily adopted by clinical sites thus paving the way to new unexplored data-sharing use cases. We tested MedCo in a real network of three institutions (EPFL, UNIL and CHUV) by focusing on an oncology use-case with real somatic mutations and clinical tumor data. The relatively low overhead introduced by MedCo shows that it represents a concrete and scalable solution for sharing privacy-conscious medical data.
